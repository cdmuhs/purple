# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Drudge expends her life in mopping,
	In emptying and filling pails;
And She will do so, never stopping,
	Until her strength entirely fails.

The Effigy got up with clothing
Abstracted from the victim's room
Is raised aleft to cheers of loathing
Before it meets a flaming doom

The Hermit lives among the boulders,
He wears no grament but a sack;
By low degrees his reason moulders,
The sun has long since burnt him black.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearance
Enough to give the strongest qualms,
Has little need of perseverance
in promting a display of alms.

The Nun is fearfully bedevilled:
She runs about and moans and shrieks;
Her flesh is bruised, her clothes dishevelled:
She's been like this for weeks and weeks.

The Proctor buys a pupil ices,
And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices
Few people even know exist.

The Quarry, fleeing from the outing,
Sinks panting in the reeds and mud:
And hearkens to the distant shouting
That tells him they are out for blood

The Suicide, as she is falling,
Illuminated by the moon,
Regrets her act, and finds appalling
The thought she will be dead so soon.
